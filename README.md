Git Workshop Instructions
=========================

##Usefulness
A Github account is almost a necessity when it comes to sharing code with a large audience, especially in the start up world. This is also great for getting jobs / internships and it allows you to work on tons of open source projects. Furthermore, if you want to start an open source project, there's no better place to start than with Github!

##What is Git?
Git is a free and open source version control system. In our opinion (and popular opinion) it is the best. Many companies require employees to know git.

##Usage!
Install with `sudo apt-get install git` (Linux) or `brew install git` (Mac) `????` (Windows)
